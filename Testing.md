Introduction
============

Guie on how to Ansible can be used to configure BIG-IP to correspond to the Unmanaged mode of APIC deployment. Goal is to perform L2-L3 stitching between the Cisco ACI fabric and F5 BIG-IP.

Pre-requisite
=============

- Ansible environment ready
    - [Tips: Getting started with ansible](https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/getting-started-with-ansible)
    - Following packages will be needed to be installed after the base ansible package is installed
      - pip install bigsuds
      - pip install f5-sdk
      - pip install netaddr
    
- BIG-IP(s)
    -   Has a MGMT IP assigned to it
    -   Licensed

- APIC
    - Configuration is in place including L4-L7 constructs required to configure BIG-IP in unmanaged mode (logical device cluster, service graph template, contract etc.)

**Note:**

- Physical cabling to the APIC and between the BIG-IP(s) (if setting up HA) is completed
- The APIC configuration DOES NOT need to be present for the ansible playbooks below to work
- The playbooks will NOT configure the APIC, only the BIG-IP

Please go through the [Standalone Physical BIG-IP](#standalone-physical-big-ip) deployment model first since detailed explanation on how to run the playbooks and expected results are provided for this model. Rest of the deployment models will follow the same structure for execution with subtle difference which are mentioned furthur in each deployment model

Topology
========

![](image1.png)

**Physical BIG-IP(s) being used in this example:**

- 192.168.73.91 -- Interface 2.2 of the BIG-IP connected to Node2/eth1-34 on the APIC
- 192.168.73.92 - Interface 2.2 of the BIG-IP connected to Node3/eth1-34 on the APIC
- Interface 1/1.8 on each vCMP host are connected to each other for HA pairing

**vCMP capable BIG-IP(s) being used in this example:**

- Host1 - 192.168.73.80 -- Interface 1/1.3 of the BIG-IP connected toNode2/eth1-39 on the APIC
    - Guest1 -- 192.168.73.82
- Host2 - 192.168.73.86 -- Interface 1/1.3 of the BIG-IP connected to Node3/eth1-39 on the APIC
    - Guest -- 192.168.73.88
- Interface 1/1.8 on each vCMP host are connected to each other for HA pairing

**Virtual Edition BIG-IP(s) being used in this example:**

- 192.168.73.180 -- Esxi host connected to Node2/eth1/10
- 192.168.73.181 -- Esxi host connected to Node2/eth1/10
- Network adaptor 1 used for management
- Network adaptor 2 and 3 used for client and server traffic
- Network adaptor 4 on each host used for HA pairing

**On APIC:**

- Tenant being used -- UM_F5_Tenant
- Logical device cluster for Physical BIG-IPs -- BIGIP_PHY
- Logical device cluster for vCMP capable BIG-IPs -- BIGIP_vCMP
- Logical device cluster for VE of BIG-IPs -- BIGIP_VE

Directory structure
===================

While following the guide below assumption is that all the folders are placed in a directory called 'playbooks'

![](image2.png)

### Sample APIC logical device configuration

This configuration is expected to be present on the APIC prior to running the playbooks. As mentioned above this is NOT a requirement but without the configuration on the APIC there will be no data traffic flowing. It is recommended to have this configuration prior to running the playbooks for the expected result.

#### Logical device configuration for Physical BIG-IP
- Logical device cluster name: BIGIP_PHY
- VLAN tags: 1195 and 1695

![](image3.png)

#### Logical device configuration for vCMP enabled BIG-IP
- Logical device cluster name: BIGIP_vCMP
- VLAN tags: 1196 and 1696

![](image4.png)

#### Logical device configuration for VE of BIG-IP
- Logical device cluster name: BIGIP_VE
- For VE the VLAN tags are not specified at the logical device cluster level but when the service graph is deployed 

#### ![](image5.png)

Deployment Models
=================

Standalone Physical BIG-IP
--------------------------

![](image6.png)

The user will need to execute only one playbook which is the main.yaml file for this particular deployment scenrario.

[Click here for scripts](http://google.com)

### Variable file

- The variable file will contain VLAN tags along with other information.The VLAN tags should match the VLAN tags configured on APIC in the logical device cluster.
- The ansible playbook will only configure the BIG-IP.

This variable file is designed to configure the following on the BIG-IP

- Onboarding : NTP, DNS, Hostname, SSH settings, Module provisioning
- Networking: 2 VLAN's, 2 Self-IP's, SNAT
    - This represents a 2 ARM mode BIG-IP connection to the APIC
        - Same interface on the BIG-IP will be used for client and server traffic
        - Separate VLAN for client and server traffic is tagged on the BIG-IP interface
    - SNAT is set to none (Assumption: Backend servers have the BIG-IP as their default gateway)
- HTTP service: Pool members, Pool, Virtual Server

### Sample variable file used
```
onboarding: "yes"                                   Do you want to onboard the BIG-IP - Options: yes/no

tenant_name_aci: "UM_F5_Tenant"	                    APIC tenant name
ldev_name_aci: "BIGIP_PHY"	                    APIC logical device cluster name
	
	
bigip_ip: 10.192.73.91	                            BIG-IP credentials

- name: "Internal_VLAN"
  id: "1695"
  interface: "2.2"
	   
static_route:	                                    Add a static route
- name: "default"
  gw_address: "10.168.56.1"
  destination: "0.0.0.0"
  netmask: "0.0.0.0"
  
bigip_selfip_information:                           Self-IP to be added to BIG-IP, tag the appropriate VLAN to the respective Self-IP
- name: 'External-SelfIP'
  address: '10.168.68.10'
  netmask: '255.255.255.0'
  vlan: "{{vlan_information[0]['name']}}"
- name: 'Internal-SelfIP'
  address: '192.168.68.10'
  netmask: '255.255.255.0'
  vlan: "{{vlan_information[1]['name']}}"	
  
service: "yes"	                                    Do you want to configure HTTP service on the BIG-IP -Options: yes/no
	
vip_name: "http_vs"	                            VIP information (Part of configuring HTTP service)
vip_port: "80"	
vip_ip: "10.168.68.105"
	
snat: "None"                                        Options: ‘None/Automap/snat-pool name’
pool_name: "web-pool"	                            Pool Information (Part of configuring HTTP service)
pool_members:	
- port: "80"	
  host: "192.168.68.140"	
- port: "80"	
  host: "192.168.68.141"	

```

If a different scenario is needed to be configured, for example BIG-IP in one arm mode, then the variable file will need to be modified
accordingly. The onboarding and http service sections will remain the same.

- VLAN and Self-IP -- only 1 entry will be needed
- SNAT: Automap can be used

### Example of the changes to the variable file
```
vlan_information:
- name: "External_VLAN"
  id: "1195"
  interface: "2.2”

bigip_selfip_information:
- name: 'External-SelfIP'
  address: '10.168.68.10'
  netmask: '255.255.255.0'
  vlan: "{{vlan_information[0]['name']}}"

snat: "Automap"
```

### Playbook execution

The main.yaml playbook will be executed. Sequence of events

- If onboarding is set to 'yes' then the onboarding.yaml playbook will be executed
- Network constructs will be configured on the BIG-IP
    - The name of the VLAN and SELF-IP will tie it to an APIC tenant
- If service is set to 'yes' then the http_service.yaml playbook will be executed
    - The name of the virtual server will tie it to an APIC tenant and LDEV

**Command to execute playbook**
Make sure you are in executing the playbook for the correct deployment scenario from the appropriate directory. (Directory: sa_phy)
-   ansible-playbook playbooks/sa_phy/main.yaml
